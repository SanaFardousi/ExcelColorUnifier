# CellColorUnifier
# Excel Color Unifier

This Python script is designed to unify cell colors in Excel spreadsheets (.xlsx) by mapping specific color codes to standard colorsâ€”red, blue, green, and orange. It utilizes the `openpyxl` library for handling Excel files and provides a function to modify cell colors based on given themes.

## Features

- Extracts Excel files from a zip folder.
- Iterates through each cell and identifies its color.
- Changes identified colors to specific shades of red, blue, green, or orange based on predefined color codes.
- Saves modified Excel files in the same format.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `openpyxl` library
- `zipfile` module (part of the standard library)

Install the `openpyxl` library using pip:

```bash
pip install openpyxl
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/excel-color-unifier.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd excel-color-unifier
   ```

3. Ensure you have the required packages installed.

## Usage

1. Prepare an Excel file or a zip folder containing multiple Excel files named `sample files.zip` in the root directory of the project.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python your_script.py
   ```
3. The script will save the modified Excel files in their original format within the same directory as the input files.

## How it Works

- The script uses `openpyxl` to load workbooks.
- Each cell's color is checked against predefined lists of color codes for red, blue, green, and orange.
- If a cell matches a specific shade, it is changed to the designated standard color.
- The modified workbooks are then saved back to their respective files.

### Important Note

The predefined color codes are specific to the Excel theme "Office 2013-2022". If using a different theme, you may need to adjust the color codes accordingly.
